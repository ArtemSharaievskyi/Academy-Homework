React Iteration, Conditional Rendering, and Modular Importing Project
Project Overview
This project is built using the React framework and focuses on iterating JSX elements, conditional rendering, and modular importing of both components and styles. The entire project is implemented using class-based components.

Assignment Details
Class Components Only:
All components must be implemented as React class components.

Modular Importing:
Use ES6 module importing for both components and CSS styles.

Component Structure:
In the App component, create and import the following components located in the src/components directory:

Header
Content
Footer
Data Constants:
Create a constants folder containing a file (e.g., data.js) that exports an array of 10â€“15 elements for lists such as posts, users, and comments.

Content Component:
Within the Content component, include all the following sub-components:

Users: Iterate through and display a list of users.
Posts: Iterate through and display a list of posts.
Comments: Iterate through and display a list of comments.
Conditional Rendering for Details:
For the Users, Posts, and Comments components:

Create a button labeled "Show Details" which toggles to "Hide Details" upon clicking.
When the "Show Details" button is clicked, conditionally render additional components:
UserDetails
PostDetails
CommentDetails
Delete Functionality:
For each user, post, and comment, include a "Delete" button that, when clicked, removes the corresponding item from the list.

Styling:
Style all components as you see fit. Optionally, you can integrate third-party libraries such as react-bootstrap, Material UI, or Tailwind CSS for enhanced design.
